# Auto-Epic7-Shop-Refresh

Hello I made this auto refresh bot for me and some of my friends
The SimpleGUI is kinda bugged but it works the way I intended in the end

--- Tested only on BlueStacks
Resolution has to be 1920Ã—1080
BlueStacks has to be on the shop and FULLSCREEN
SimpleGUI when you initialize the bot it will get an error ( cause it wasn't made to work this way),
  but when it finishes your task, it will come back and show the results
For this to work you'll need:
pywin32, pyautogui, pysimplegui and opencv-python installed
