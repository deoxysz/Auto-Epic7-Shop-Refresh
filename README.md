# E7ShopRefresher

## Hello I made this auto refresh bot for me and some of my friends, but anyone can use it,  I also want to make it an executable to make it easier to people to use it


**How to use:**
- Download and Install python
- Open the terminal and go to the paste you downloaded the code and type: 
**pip install -r requirements.txt**
- Still in the paste, run the code by typing the following command in the terminal: 
**python main.py**

**Before you try:**
- Resolution has to be 1920Ã—1080
- BlueStacks has to be on the shop and FULLSCREEN
- F5 stops the shop refreshing after refreshing for one last time

**Tested emulators:**


-Works on: Bluestacks


-Does not work on: MuMu Player


If you still have problems after installing the requirements, try installing them manually:
  **pip install pywin32 pyautogui pysimplegui opencv-python keyboard**
